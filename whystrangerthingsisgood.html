<p>One of the reasons why this show is so good is because of the cast. The casting in this show is simply outstanding and all the credit goes to the casting director, Carmen Cuba. She not only managed to find amazing adult actors but, amazing child actors. Some of the main cast members are Winona Ryder, David Harbour, and Millie Bobby Brown. Every single actor, in my opinion, did incredible job as their role.</p>

<p>Another reason this show is so good is the nostalgia. As I said before Stranger Things is set in the 80's so the nostalgia hit a lot of people. There are a lot of film references and easter eggs, some of the films include Star Wars, Jaws, The Goonies, and more. All of the clothing have an ET feeling to them, which people loved. All of the nostalgia in this show amazing, it makes you feel like you're in the 80's.</p>

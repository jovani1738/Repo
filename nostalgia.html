<p>Another reason this show is so good is the nostalgia. Stranger Things is a brilliant throwback to classic 80's film writing. From the soundtrack to all the clothing, they perfected that 80's feeling. It even has 80's stars, Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine in the cast. All of the nostalgia in this show amazing, it makes you feel like you're in the 80's.</p>
<p>This show is filled with 80's culture, the music, fashion, books, games, and movies. There are a lot of film references, some of the films include Star Wars, Jaws, The Goonies, and more. They got a lot of inspiration from Steven Spielberg and Stephen King movies. Its like Stephen King shot through the lens of Steven Spielberg. All of the clothing have an ET feeling to them, which people loved.</p>

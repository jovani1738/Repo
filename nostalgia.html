<p>Another reason this show is so good is the nostalgia. As I said before Stranger Things is set in the 80's so the nostalgia hit a lot of people. There are a lot of film references and easter eggs, some of the films include Star Wars, Jaws, The Goonies, and more. All of the clothing have an ET feeling to them, which people loved. All of the nostalgia in this show amazing, it makes you feel like you're in the 80's.</p>

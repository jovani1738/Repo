<p>Another reason this show is so good is the nostalgia. As I said before Stranger Things is set in the 80's so the nostalgia affected a lot of people. From the soundtrack to all the clothing, they perfected that 80's feeling. It even has 80's stars, Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine in the cast. All of the nostalgia in this show amazing, it makes you feel like you're in the 80's.</p>
<p>There are a lot of film references and easter eggs, some of the films include Star Wars, Jaws, The Goonies, and more. They got a lot of inspiration from Steven Spielberg and Stephen King movies. All of the clothing have an ET feeling to them, which people loved.</p>

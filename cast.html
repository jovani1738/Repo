<p>One of the reasons why this show is so good is because of the cast. The casting in this show is simply outstanding and all the credit goes to the casting director, Carmen Cuba. She not only managed to find amazing adult actors but, amazing child actors. Some of the main cast members are Winona Ryder, David Harbour, and Millie Bobby Brown. Every single actor, in my opinion, did incredible job as their role.</p>

<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>All of the characters are terrific. Some of the best characters are Joyce Byers, Jim Hopper, Eleven, and Dustin Henderson. Joyce Byers is a divorced supermarket cashier and Will and Jonathan Byers single mother. Jim Hopper is the town of Hawkins Police Chief and main investigator of Will's disappearance. Eleven is a mysterious little girl with telekinetic powers found by Mike and his friends. Dustin Henderson is one of the best, if not the bset character in the show. He is an enthusiastic chubby boy with a lisp who helps his friends search for will.</p>
